# What Is this?
Enova has decided to open source it's career ladders. You can find background on why we created new ladders [here]() and why we open sourced them [here]().

# What's inside?
There's 6 ladders contained:
* core_engineer - This is the basis of every engineer, regardless of your specific focus. These items apply to Software, Rest and UI engineers
* software_engineer - Software Engineer Ladder
* software_ui_engineer - Software UI Engineer Ladder
* software_test_engineer - Software Test Engineer Ladder
* individual_contributor - Principal Engineer Ladder
* mangement - Manager Ladder

For more information on the split between Principal Engineers & Mangement, see the referenced blog posts above.

# Definitions
Within the ladders there's some Enova specific terminology:
* Core - We have organized teams focused on either specific products or internal operations. These core teams don't change that often. This is ~65% of our engineering team.
* Ranger - The remaining engineers are broken out into 4 person ranger teams. These teams are assigned every 6 weeks during a company wide prioritization stagegate process known as EPG.
* SE - Software Engineering
* Architecture Council - Large, cross functional team made up of members of SE, IT, Analytics, Data Services and TechOps that help organize company wide projects and iniatives.
* 


# Why Ugly Markdown?
Markdown doesn't represent tables / matrices well. GFM only supports single line table cells, so they wouldn't work here. If you have some suggestions, please, open up an issue.
